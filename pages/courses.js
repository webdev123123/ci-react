                      Franciscan University has recently created an Institute for Priestly Renewal (IPR) that assists diocesan bishops and religious superiors as they work to form their priests and seminarians for leadership roles in the new evangelization. The courses and resources available through the IPR seek to provide seminarians and priests with deeper formation for missionary outreach. They also aim to help them create a parish culture of discipleship and outward-oriented evangelization. In partnership with the IPR, the Catechetical Institute helps seminarians and priests understand authentically Catholic approaches to outreach and inculturation, as well as communicate the kerygma effectively with strong follow-up.
                    </p>
                    <p className="flow-text">
                      By using a summertime on-campus format, the design of the IPR closely accords with the timeframes and structure used by the Institute for Priestly Formation (IPF) of Omaha, Nebraska. The formation IPR offers is not redundant with IPF’s goals, but instead complements its outstanding work in spiritual formation, spiritual direction, and the interior life of clergy. The format used by Franciscan’s IPR draws from the catechumenal model (the three-fold liturgical, catechetical, pastoral pattern), and depends upon expertise from many directions within and outside of the Franciscan University family. The most critical human component of this structure is its dependence on priestly mentorship. It is a “like-to-like” learning model, relying on bringing in priests in the field with reputations for excellence in areas the IPR addresses.

                    the building up of her members. So great and splendid is the educational

                    ministry of Christian parents that St. Thomas has no hesitation in comparing

                    it with the ministry of priests: ‘Some only propagate and guard spiritual life

                    by a spiritual ministry: this is the role of the sacrament of orders; others do

                    this for both corporal and spiritual life, and this is brought about by the

                    sacrament of marriage, by which a man and a woman join in order to beget

                    offspring and bring them up to worship God.’”

                    Working with this understanding, the Catechetical Institute views parenting as the

                    critical catechetical role in the Church. Our desire is to help families in our

                    workshops in this track are not intended to result in any certification, but instead

                    aim at a far more fundamental end: forming adults who know how to live a

                    missionary life in marriage and judge nothing in life as great as the work of parenting

                    toward sainthood and striving for spousal sanctity. To foster this, a great variety of

                    pragmatic and imaginative workshops are offered by the Catechetical Institute as

                    electives in every track and collected together in this track.

                    to the Person of Jesus Christ (who is the content of all catechesis) through the use of

                    contemporary and ancient sacred art, Christian and secular forms of music, popular

                    The primary audience of this three-part series of workshops is those working in any

                    ministry setting—clergy or laity—whose interactions with others require

                    mentoring skills, evangelical hospitality, ongoing pastoral interactions in the course

                    of catechetical work, small group facilitation, parenting, nurturing, and intercessory

                    prayer outreach. Anyone who has some degree of work in the care of souls can

                    benefit significantly from these workshops.

                    This track is divided into three areas of emphasis in pastoral accompaniment: 1)

                    Mentoring; 2) Spiritual Guidance; and 3) Counseling. Workshops in each of these

                    areas are not designed for professional counselors, spiritual directors, or similar

                    niche roles, but instead for those in more general catechetical or ministerial roles.

                    This track’s diverse content is also applicable to every parent, every priest, and

                    every parishioner who understands the demanding call upon all baptized believers

                    to love generously and serve sacrificially.

                    two-part series of workshops to provide formation for youth ministers. It includes

                    presentations that are practical, academic, theological, and spiritual, all while

                    stressing that the most important factor in successfully evangelizing and discipling

                    adolescents is the human one: the authentic witness and genuine love of those willing

                    to invest in the spiritual growth of younger souls. This track also helps youth

                    Campus ministry at today’s colleges and universities has become an immensely

                    challenging endeavor. This track offers a two-part set of workshops designed to

                    meet the unique needs of those tasked with ministering to young people during this

                    transient and tumultuous time of life. At the heart of this track is a recognition that

                    any effort to evangelize and make disciples of college students must start with a

                    carefully formed Catholic worldview and a genuine missionary mindset. Workshops by

                    veteran campus ministers explore the essential steps for developing and growing an

                    effective campus ministry program that is attentive both to seekers and those

                    needing deeper, ongoing spiritual growth. Attention is particularly given to

                    achieving sustained long-term growth with college students, not just short-term

                    gains.

                    This track is intended for any individual—clergy or lay, active in ministry or

                    not—who desires to develop the ability to proclaim the Gospel to others.

                    Workshops in this two-part series address the critical content of the basic Gospel

                    message; the historical ways in which it has been unfolded; the nature of conversion

                    and faith development; the natural and necessary connection between

                    evangelization and a deeper exploration of the faith; best practices in the field in a

                    wide range of circumstances; skills development; the place of apologetics; specific

                    avenues to evangelize families; and the need to be well-formed in the pastoral and

                    spiritual aspects of outreach. A special feature of this track is a far-reaching series of

                    interviews with many Catholics who are currently doing creative and effective

                    evangelization work in a myriad of contexts.

                    The influence of music in most people’s lives is profound. The Church’s long

                    experience and wisdom also recognizes that music is a salvific tool, a gift of beauty

                    arising from human talent and a supernatural charism that is often graced by God in

                    order to aid and deepen conversion, draw forth repentance, foster spiritual peace,

                    heighten worship, and stoke zeal. The workshops in this track offer an inclusive

                    exploration of the Church’s vision for music ministry and the myriad practical ways

                    it can be encouraged in ecclesial settings, wielded in formative experiences, and

                    developed and matured in the lives of children, teens, and adults. Of particular focus

                    is an open look at the relative value of various genres of Christian music in a modern

                    setting and how preserving a vibrant Catholic family life from a pervasively acidic

                    secular culture can be greatly aided by the gift of sacred sound.
